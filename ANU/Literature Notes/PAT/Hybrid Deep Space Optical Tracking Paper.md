This paper from 2007 explores some of the difficulties associated with deep space FSOC systems, particularly to do with an Earth-Mars link.

Similarly to the [[1999 Proposed Europa Orbiter]] paper, this paper considers using the Earth itself as a downlink beacon. However, it notes that fluctuations in the Earth's albedo can interfere with this process. The [[1999 Proposed Europa Orbiter]] paper made similar considerations, and ruled out the possibility of a completely reliable powered beacon from the Earth due to inconsistent lighting conditions from the planet itself. I would have to calculate the albedo variance from the moon to determine whether this would be an issue for a lunar laser communications system, though I doubt it would be given the [[NASA LLCD]] project.
