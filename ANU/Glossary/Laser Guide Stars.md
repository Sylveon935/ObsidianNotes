In order to calibrate adaptive optics systems to correct for atmospheric turbulence, a [[Wavefront Sensor]] (WFS) is used to quantify the aberrations, which is then corrected by a deformable mirror. In order to quantify the atmospheric distortion, the WFS must interpret light from a 'guide star'. Traditionally, natural guide stars (literal stars in the sky) with known light characteristics have been used to determine the extent of image warping induced by the atmosphere. It is also possible to create an 'artificial' or _laser guide star_ (LGS) by using lasers, which can then be interpreted by the WFS.
 
The most common way to create laser guide stars is using a laser to excite sodium atoms in the atmosphere at the 90-100km altitude range. The so-called sodium LGS will emit a specific wavelength of 589.2nm, meaning aberrations at the telescope can easily be corrected for by the adaptive optics system. The sodium LGS is created at the same viewing angle as the science object to be viewed, as seen below.
