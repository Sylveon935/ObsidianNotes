A Nasmyth telescope is a type of telescope which functions by allowing incident light to strike a concave primary mirror, which is then directed toward a convex secondary mirror. A third, smaller mirror then reflects that light toward an altitude bearing. This bearing allows the telescope's position to be adjusted without the eyepiece needing to move. This facilitates the ability to install heavy attachments on the telescope without disrupting the lens system, or placing undue weight on the bearings. Nasmyth telescopes are therefore quite useful for research applications which require advanced analysis instruments to be attached directly to the telescope.
