The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is an international body that develops resources and standards for spaceflight. The CCSDS regularly publishes standards (sorted by book colour) which aim to improve the safety and reliability of spaceflight systems, as well as compatibility between different space agencies. NASA has elected to implement the CCSDS' High Photon Efficiency (HPE) standard for optical communication protocol for its Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) and Optical to Orion (O2O) missions.
 
The HPE standard is based on the publication CCSDS 141.1-R-1-v10 Draft Red Book from April 25, 2018. The optical communications systems operating under this standard's assumptions are available as a Matlab model from ([https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-19882-1](https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-19882-1)). The HPE is used to inform the construction and implementation of several deep space communication systems, including ANU's QOGS.
