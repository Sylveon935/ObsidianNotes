Superconductivity occurs when an eligible element is cooled to an extremely low temperature past what is called its _critical temperature_, or Tc. To review the structure of a metallic lattice, positive ions remain in a fixed grid position, whilst electrons flow freely throughout the structure. This forms the basis of conductivity, as free-moving electrons are capable of carrying current. These electrons encounter resistance, however, when thermal-induced vibrations experienced by positive ions apply electromagnetic pressure to the electrons in directions other than the direction of current. This means that, under regular conditions, all conductors experience current loss in some way.
 
When a conductor's temperature is dropped below its Tc (usually close to 0K), which is different for each element, it begins to experience absolutely zero resistance. This cooling is typically achieved by exposing the conductor to an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium (~3K). Under these conditions, the positive ions experience such a negligible amount of thermal vibration that it ceases to disrupt the flow of current. However, as electrons pass by the positive ions, the ions are attracted toward the electrons, creating a localised zone of positive charge which overwhelms the electromagnetically negative charge exerted by the electron.

As electrons travel through the superconductive lattice, they constantly attract positive ions toward them. Since this creates pockets of positive charge, other electrons are attracted toward these pockets. When two electrons become attracted to the positive regions they are creating, they are bound in a _Cooper pair_. Cooper pairs move together through the lattice, and are responsible for the phenomenon of superconductivity.

Since electrons are fermions (with spin 1/2), two electrons are not allowed to occupy the same space and quantum state. However, when two electrons form a Cooper pair, the overall spin of the state ends up as either 0 or 1. This means that Cooper pairs functionally behave as bosons, rather than fermions. As a result, multiple Cooper pairs can (and often do) overlap and occupy the same space, whilst also residing at the lowest energy state possible. This means that Cooper pairs can co-exist with one another ubiquitously throughout the entire lattice structure.
 
For all superconductors, there exists a _critical current_, which is the greatest current that can be carried through the material before it loses its superconductive properties. This phenomenon forms the basis of how SNSPDs function.
