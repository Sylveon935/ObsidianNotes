Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are the fastest single photon detectors for photon counting, and are used in the QOGS. These detectors rely on deliberately pushing superconductive nanowire past its critical current threshold to produce a localised region of non-[[Superconductivity]], and hence a voltage output which can be used to detect the presence of photons.
 
To achieve this, the nanowire is cooled well below its critical temperature, and a current is applied to the wire just slightly below its critical current. When an incident photon strikes the nanowire, it is capable of breaking the Cooper pairs within the lattice. This causes the critical current to reduce in the local region, thereby inducing a very small degree of electrical resistance. This results in an output voltage, which can be used to detect the presence of a photon. This can be very useful in photon-starved environments.
