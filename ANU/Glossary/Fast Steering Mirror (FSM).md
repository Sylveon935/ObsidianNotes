A fast steering mirror (FSM) is a correction element implemented within free space optical systems to redirect an incident beam of light under rapidly changing and dynamic conditions. FSMs are very sophisticated devices, which can move extremely rapidly in the X and Y planes, thanks to on-board actuators. FSMs can typically deflect incident beams of light several degrees in all directions.
 
FSMs are an elegant solution to some of the most unpredictable complications associated with free space optics, such as atmospheric turbulence. The QOGS uses many FSMs, such as in its receiving system, where it operates in a [[Closed Loop System]] using a tracking camera to inform its movements.
