The brightness of an object can be characterised in accordance with its _magnitude_; a quantifiable measure of the object's exact brightness. _Apparent magnitude_ refers to the magnitude that an observer at a given location (usually Earth) would measure, whereas _absolute magnitude_ refers to the true magnitude of an object assuming no distance separation from the observer. The lower the magnitude, the brighter an object is. Below is a scale showing some useful reference magnitudes.
