In order to correct for wavefront aberrations in adaptive optics systems, deformable mirrors can be used. These mirrors are capable of correcting incident aberrated wavefronts at a local level by deforming extremely small regions of its own surface. The objective of deformable mirrors is to create several small, deformed regions which negate the effects of aberrations, such as atmospheric turbulence. Due to the high frequency and low settling times demanded by adaptive optics systems, deformable mirrors must be driven by actuators which aren't physically mechanical in nature.
 
One example of a deformable mirror type is _voice coil_ deformable mirrors. Voice coils function by using coiled wire surrounded by a permanent magnet. When the coil is pumped with electricity, it becomes an electromagnet, thus its position can be manipulated by the surrounding permanent magnet. By moderating the supplied electricity, precise magnetic actuation can be produced. Voice coils are capable of producing extreme levels of acceleration (>80Gs), and are the foundation of how speakers and microphones work. Voice coils can be applied to deformable mirrors to achieve high precision, high speed localised deformation; desirable characteristics for closed loop adaptive optics systems. Below is a diagram of a voice coil based deformable mirror.

The second most popular time of deformable mirror are micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). MEMS mirrors are actuated using electrostatic force between a thin film and an electrode. When the electrode receives electricity, the film is either attracted or repelled, resulting in controllable, one-dimensional actuation. The film is typically attached to the deformable mirror's surface using a mirror post as seen in the image below. This allows the mirror facesheet to be deformed without relying on mechanical components.
