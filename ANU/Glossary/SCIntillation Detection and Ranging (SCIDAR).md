SCIDAR is used at Mount Stromlo to characterise the atmospheric turbulence profile for the QOGS. SCIDAR works by observing a binary star system, in which the stars have a known separation of θ. The light from these stars pass through the atmosphere and encounter turbulence at height _h_. At the ground, two identical aberration measurements are recorded at _d = h_θ. This will result in two peaks which correspond to the height of the layers of turbulence, with the amplitude of the peaks correlating to the strength of the layers. This measurement is improved by using two SCIDAR detectors in a so-called stereo SCIDAR configuration, which Mount Stromlo plans to implement in the near future.
