A closed loop system is a type of configuration that uses a _feedback signal_ to inform the instructions given to a correcting element. For instance, the QOGS' receiver uses a tracking camera to determine whether the fast steering mirror is redirecting light at the correct angle. The most notable feature of closed loop systems is that they rely on _real-time feedback_ within the system to determine how a correcting element should behave, rather than relying on a systems model. The diagram below illustrates a generic example of a closed loop system.
