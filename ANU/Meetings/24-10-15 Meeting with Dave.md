**How well does it work with different angles**?

- Could be possible but would require a lot of calibration
- The difference between two craters will mainly be based on size, shape and lighting
- If the magnification remains the same, zooming in may cause a specific crater to not be identified

**Using RF antennae to designate a search area**

- Sounds reasonable
- Object detection models (YOLO) could be used to find the rover within the search area
- Basically chops up the images into small pixel squares, and tries to determine whether pixels have the object in question in view

**Can we just train it to find the rover?**

- Probably can't just detect it (at least using Google Maps' data)
- Might be possible with a higher resolution map



- Dave also suggests using a reinforcement algorithm to assist in defining a search area
